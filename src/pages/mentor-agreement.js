          <p>
            C. BridgeAcademy may communicate to each Candidate whose Application
            was sent to Mentor whether or not Mentor is interested in
            interviewing them. BridgeAcademy may at its sole discretion decide
            not to notify a particular Candidate of Mentor’s desire to interview
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            D. Mentor is fully responsible for their conduct during
            conversations and online exchanges with any Candidate, whether while
            using the Services or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            E. BridgeAcademy may provide to Candidate(s) who were not selected
            by Mentor information about any Candidate(s) who were selected

            F. Mentor shall make themselves available for a period of time no
            less than the Weekly Mentorship Commitment during each week of the
            Formal Mentorship Period. Mentor must make reasonable efforts to
            meet their Weekly Mentorship Commitment by offering convenient times
            to Mentees during the Formal Mentorship Period.
          </p>
          <p>
            G. Mentor must notify Mentees immediately if at any time they become
            aware that they will be unable to meet their Weekly Mentorship
            Commitment during the Formal Mentorship Period.
          </p>
          <p>
            H. In the event that Mentor is unable to fulfill the Weekly
            Mentorship Commitment on any particular week during the Formal
            Mentorship Period, Mentor will offer additional Mentorship in
            subsequent weeks to compensate.
          </p>
          <p>
            I. Mentor understands that they shall be entitled to no Compensation
            unless that Mentee becomes employed within two (2) years of the
            conclusion of the Formal Mentorship Period, in an Eligible Field.
            Mentor understands that they shall not be entitled to any fraction
            of the Compensation until BridgeAcademy has received payment from
            the Mentee with whom they were engaged for Mentorship, for the
            corresponding fraction of the Mentee's fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            J. In the event that a Mentee should decline to continue to receive
            Mentorship from Mentor prior to the conclusion of the Formal
            Mentorship Period, including in the case in which Mentee becomes
            employed during the course of the Formal Mentorship Period, Mentor’s
            Compensation shall be determined by BridgeAcademy, at its sole and
            exclusive discretion.

          <p>

            threatened breach, of any of the foregoing provisions, each Party
            recognizes that the harm suffered by the other Party may not be
            compensable by monetary damages alone and, accordingly, that the
            other Party shall, in addition to other available legal or equitable
            remedies, be entitled to seek a preliminary and permanent injunctive
            and other equitable relief to prevent, discontinue, and/or restrain
            against such breach or threatened breach. Each Party further

            reasonable respects with the Disclosing Party to minimize the impact
            of the disclosure or loss and any damage resulting therefrom.

          <p>
            <strong>F. Return of information.</strong> Upon the Disclosing
            Party’s written request, the Receiving Party will make commercially
            reasonable efforts to promptly return or destroy all tangible and
            electronic material, in any form, embodying Confidential Information
            of the Disclosing Party. In carrying out any destruction, the
            Receiving Party will protect Confidential Information in accordance
            with the terms of this Agreement. The obligations set out in this
            Section shall not apply to such Confidential Information which the
