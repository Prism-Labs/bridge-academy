            the purpose of this Agreement.

          <p>
            <strong>I.</strong> “Prism Labs Income Share Percentage” is the

            Income Share Percentage shall be equal to % of Candidate's salary,
            plus applicable taxes and transaction fees, for the first 36 months
            of Candidate's employment in an Eligible Field.
          </p>

          <h2 className="legalese-title">
            2. Mentorship of and engagement with mentors
          </h2>
          <p>
            J. In the event that Mentor is unable to fulfill the Weekly
            Mentorship Commitment on any particular week during the Formal
            Mentorship Period, Mentor will offer additional Mentorship in
            subsequent weeks to compensate.
          </p>
          <p>
            K. If Mentor has fulfilled their Weekly Mentorship Commitment with
            respect to a particular Candidate throughout the Formal Mentorship
            Period, BridgeAcademy shall be entitled to a sum equal the Payment
            Obligation, plus applicable taxes and transaction fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            L. Candidate shall not owe the Payment Obligation unless Candidate
            becomes employed in an Eligible Field within two (2) years following
            the conclusion of the Formal Mentorship Period (hereafter, the
            "Repayment Period"), in an Eligible Field.
          </p>
          <p>
            M. In the event that Candidate becomes employed during the Formal
            Mentorship Period, Candidate shall still owe the full Payment
            Obligation, subject to any adjustments determined by BridgeAcademy
            in its sole and exclusive discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            N. In the event that Candidate becomes employed in an Eligible Field
            during the Repayment Period, but subsequently loses that employment,
            Candidate shall not owe the Payment Obligation during the months
            Candidate is not employed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such a
            Candidate, having lost their earlier employment, should
            subsequently, and within the Repayment Period, find employment in an
            Eligible Field, Candidate shall owe the Payment Obligation
            associated with Candidate's new position. For clarity, the Payment
            Obligation shall be calculated based on the salary earned by
            Candidate in respect of each applicable employment for a total of 36
            months.
          </p>
          <h2 className="legalese-title">3. Payment schedule</h2>
          <p>
            A. The Payment Obligation shall be payable starting on the first day
            of the Candidate’s employment in an Eligible Field, as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            B. Candidate hereby agrees to submit, within one month of hire, to
            BridgeAcademy evidence of employment salary. The forms acceptable to
            Prism Labs Include, but are not limited to, signed employment
            agreement, employer pay stub and T4 slips (collectively, "Proof of
            Salary"). Unless otherwise specified in writing between
            BridgeAcademy and Candidate, in the event that Candidate fails to
            provide Proof of Salary within 30 days, Candidate agrees that
            BridgeAcademy, in its sole discretion, may determine the Payment
            Obligation. Candidate further agrees to submit their credit card, or
            other payment information to BridgeAcademy as collateral for
            enforcement of this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            C. Candidate hereby agrees that, at BridgeAcademy request, Candidate
            shall make available to BridgeAcademy Candidate's tax filings for a
            period from the beginning of the Formal Mentorship Period, to up to
            three (3) years following the end of the Formal Mentorship Period,
            which may be used by BridgeAcademy as evidence of Candidate's
            employment status for the purpose of enforcing this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            D. BridgeAcademy and Candidate's Mentor may, at their sole and
            exclusive discretion, offer to defer payment for Candidate's
            employment until some pre-determined milestone has been reached (for
            example, Candidate's promotion to full-time status, Candidate's
            being offered a raise, or at an agreed-upon date). In the event of
            such a deferral, the salary used for the purpose of calculating the
            Payment Obligation owed to BridgeAcademy shall be Candidate's salary
            as of the deferred payment date. Specifically, if Candidate's salary
            increases between the date on which their employment begins, and the
            date to which their repayment has been deferred, then the new,
            higher salary will be used, and Candidate shall owe the
            corresponding, increased Payment Obligation.

            4. Confidentiality and intellectual property
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Protection.</strong> Both parties agree to protect the
            Confidential Information of the other party. For purposes of this
            Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all data and information
            that is disclosed to the other party during their relationship
            including, without limitation, documents, components, parts,
            information, drawings, data, sketches, plans, tracks,
            specifications, techniques, processes, software, algorithms,
            inventions and other materials, both written and oral, of a secret,
            confidential or proprietary nature, including, without limitation,
            any and all information relating to business models or practices,
            marketing, finance, forecasts, invention, research, design or
            development of information systems and any supportive or incidental
            subsystems, and any and all subject matter claimed in or disclosed
            by any patent application in preparation, prepared or filed by or on
            behalf of the disclosing party, in any jurisdiction, and any
            amendments or supplements thereto.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Ownership.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed upon in
            writing between Candidate and a particular Mentor, all right, title
            and interest in the work produced by Candidate, including all
            copyright and intellectual property rights, shall belong to the
            Candidate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Third-party IP.</strong> Candidate agrees that, in the
            course of the Mentorship, neither BridgeAcademy nor the Mentor shall
            be required to disclose any trade secrets, know-how, Confidential
            Information, or other intellectual property that BridgeAcademy or
            the Mentor may have acquired from or developed for a third party
            ("Third-Party IP"). Third-Party IP includes, without limitation, any
            intellectual property of (a) any former or current employer of the
            Mentor; (b) any former or current client of BridgeAcademy; or (c)
            any other person to whom or entity to which either BridgeAcademy or
            the Mentor have a legal obligation regarding the use or disclosure
            of such intellectual property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. Injunctive relief.</strong> In the event of a breach, or
            threatened breach, of any of the foregoing provisions, each Party
            recognizes that the harm suffered by the other Party may not be
            compensable by monetary damages alone and, accordingly, that the
            other Party shall, in addition to other available legal or equitable
            remedies, be entitled to seek a preliminary and permanent injunctive
            and other equitable relief to prevent, discontinue, and/or restrain
            against such breach or threatened breach. Each Party further
            undertakes to notify the other Party of any breach of the foregoing
            provisions as soon as such Party is made aware of any such breach.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. Notification of breach</strong> If there is any actual or
            threatened unauthorized access to, disclosure or loss of, or
            inability to account for, any Confidential Information of the
            Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will: (i) promptly, but in any
            event within 5 days after becoming aware of it, notify the
            Disclosing Party; (ii) take such actions as may be necessary or as
            may be requested by the Disclosing Party, acting reasonably, to
            prevent any further disclosure or loss and to minimize the
            consequences of such disclosure or loss; and (iii) cooperate in all
            reasonable respects with the Disclosing Party to minimize the impact
            of the disclosure or loss and any damage resulting therefrom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6. Return of information.</strong> Upon the Disclosing
            Party’s written request, the Receiving Party will make commercially
            reasonable efforts to promptly return or destroy all tangible and
            electronic material, in any form, embodying Confidential Information
            of the Disclosing Party. In carrying out any destruction, the
            Receiving Party will protect Confidential Information in accordance
            with the terms of this Agreement. The obligations set out in this
            Section shall not apply to such Confidential Information which the
            Receiving Party is obligated to retain as a result of legal or
            regulatory requirements for any other such like reason. In addition
            to the foregoing, either party may retain data or electronic records
            containing the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of
            permitting it to satisfy its bona fide record retention obligations
            or enterprise policies.

            ordinances, codes and regulations of governmental agencies,

            The work produced by Candidate(s) and related information may be
            subject to export and import restrictions. Candidate shall comply
            with any laws which may impact its right to export, import or use
            the work and related information (including, without limitation,
            United States and International export laws). Neither party shall
            use the work or related information for any purposes prohibited by
            applicable laws.

          </p>
          <h2 className="legalese-title">8. Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            Except for the Parties’ confidentiality obligations in Section 4,
            neither party will be liable to the other party for any incidental,

            and regardless of the cause of action. The aggregate liability of
            BridgeAcademy with respect to the present Agreement will in no event
            exceed the aggregate Payment Obligation paid by Candidate to
            BridgeAcademy under the present Agreement during the six (6) months
            immediately preceding the date on which such a claim arises.
          </p>

            <strong>D. Term.</strong> This Agreement shall enter into effect at
            the date on which it is executed by both BridgeAcademy and Candidate
            (the “Effective Date”) and shall continue until any and all payments

          <p>
            <strong>E. Termination.</strong> Either party may terminate the

            to Candidate (and without Candidate's consent) assign this Agreement
            in its entirety to a parent company, any subsidiary of a parent

            be, imply or suggest a waiver with respect to any preceding or
            succeeding breach of this or any other Agreement between
            BridgeAcademy and Candidate. No waiver by BridgeAcademy or Candidate
            of any right under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of

          <p>
            <strong>I. Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement is the final,
